# Cifar10 Image Classification
A numpy based CNN implementation for classifying Cifar 10 images

This was a fun project to try and implement a CNN by myself. In process, I was able to implement a reusable (numpy based)
library-ish code for creating CNNs with adam optimization.   
Still working on better and more reusable adam optimization code.  

The CNN implemented here is based on [Andrej Karpathy's notes](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)
